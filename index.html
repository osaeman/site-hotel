            <h1 class="video-section-upper-heading">Hotel-Site: Why Tourist Choose It </h1>
            <p class="video-section-upper-para">It was found that the vast majority of  guests use the service for a leisure trip, and although it is
                sometimes perceived as appealing to “backpacker” travellers, only a relatively small percentage of guests
                 describe themselves as backpackers. Also, most  guests rent an entire home, rather than staying 
                 together with a host, even though entire home rentals are somewhat divergent from classic
                  “sharing economy” activity. Additionally, most guests stay from two to four nights and stay with at 
                  least one other guest, most commonly a spouse/partner. Moreover, most guests still have
                   relatively minimal  experience and began using the service only quite recently. 
                    guests are most strongly attracted to its practical attributes (e.g., cost, location, and 
                   amenities), and somewhat less by its experiential attributes (e.g., novelty and interaction)</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="video-section-lower-para">The comparative importance of  practical benefits contrasts with it’s advertising,
                which focuses almost exclusively on authentic local experiences and interaction with locals, 
                with no mention of cost and limited mention of other practical benefits. The majority of guests
                use it as a substitute for hotels, whereas very few use it to take a trip they would not have 
                otherwise taken. Nonetheless, staying with hotel site leads many guests to increase the time they 
                spend in a destination. In other words, it does not stimulate significant additional visitation,
                as some figures it reported suggest, but it may nonetheless bring benefits to local tourism
                economies.</p>
